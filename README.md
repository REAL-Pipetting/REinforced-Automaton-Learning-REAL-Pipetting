# REinforced-Automaton-Learning-REAL-Pipetting
This project integrates reinforcement learning with the open source pipetting robots from Opentrons (OT2) to guide future batched trials in high throughput experiments. We utilize two reinforcement learning algorithms:
1. Genetic Algorithm
2. Gaussian Process Batch Upper Confidence Bound (GP-BUCB)<sup>1</sup>
